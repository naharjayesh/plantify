                        Houseplants have made a big comeback these days, taking
                        over homes, offices, and social media, making it hard to
                        miss. We profile 14 Popular Houseplants (and How to Keep
                        Them Alive) in this blog post, complete with pictures
                        and care instructions. <br />
                        It used to be that you would only see houseplants in the
                        homes of those obsessed with plants or flowers. No more.
                        Millennials are driving the new popularity for
                        houseplants and finding they are not just for decor but
                        can be useful for so many other things as well. For one,
                        many plants detoxify our air, and some, like the aloe
                        vera, are used in beauty and health products.

                                over-fertilized and grown in warm conditions,
                                but not given enough light, will stretch out

                                light without a corresponding increase in
                                fertilizer and water will scorch. The right

                                Majesty palm has a reputation for being somewhat
                                of a temperamental plant. Kentia palm, bamboo
                                palm, or parlor palm plants are generally better
                                choices for beginner indoor gardeners.
                                Successfully growing majesty palms requires
                                carefully balancing several factors: heat,
                                light, and fertilization. Plants that are
                                over-fertilized and grown in warm conditions,
                                but not given enough light, will stretch out
                                looking for more. Plants that are given too much
                                light without a corresponding increase in
                                fertilizer and water will scorch. The right
                                balance indoors likely means a bright corner,
                                with plenty of water, and probably less
                                fertilizer than you think.
